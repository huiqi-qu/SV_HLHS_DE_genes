# Differential Gene Expression in SV/HLHS Patients

This repository provides interactive visualizations of differential gene expression across 15 immune cell types, derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with Single Ventricle / Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (SV/HLHS).

The data includes two searchable gene expression tables:

- ðŸ”— **[Main DE Genes Table](https://huiqi-qu.github.io/SV_HLHS_DE_genes/index.html)** â€” Logâ‚‚ fold changes for 6,660 genes across immune cell types
- ðŸ”— **[Opposite-Direction DE Genes Table](https://huiqi-qu.github.io/SV_HLHS_DE_genes/opposite.html)** â€” Subset of 822 genes showing opposite regulation across different cell types

Each table allows users to search by gene name, filter by cell type, and explore expression patterns interactively.

## Data Description

- **Rows**: Genes
- **Columns**: Cell types (e.g., B cells, monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets)
- **Values**: Logâ‚‚ fold changes between SV/HLHS patients and controls

Missing values indicate no significant expression difference in that cell type. Column headers have been simplified to remove formatting issues (e.g., no commas or superscripts).
