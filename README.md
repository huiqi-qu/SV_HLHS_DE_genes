# Differential Gene Expression in SV/HLHS Patients

This repository provides an interactive visualization of differential gene expression across 15 immune cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with Single Ventricle / Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (SV/HLHS).

The table is based on differential expression (logâ‚‚ fold change) of 6,660 genes across immune subsets. Users can search by gene name and examine expression patterns across cell types.

## Data Description

- **Rows**: Genes (n = 6,660)
- **Columns**: Cell types, including B cells, monocytes, NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets
- **Values**: Logâ‚‚ fold change in expression between SV/HLHS cases and matched controls per cell type

Headers have been cleaned to improve compatibility (e.g., replacing commas and superscript characters).
